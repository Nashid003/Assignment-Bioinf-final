Bioinformatics Analysis: Gene Expression, Tree Growth, and Sequence Diversity
This repository contains an R workflow for analyzing gene expression data, tree growth measurements, and biological sequence diversity. The analyses are divided into two parts: Part 1 focuses on RNA-seq gene expression data and tree circumference measurements, while Part 2 examines coding sequence diversity in Escherichia coli and Clostridium baratii.
Features
Part 1: Gene Expression and Tree Growth Analysis

Data Import and Wrangling: Import and process RNA-seq count data (gene_expression.tsv) and tree circumference measurements (growth_data.csv).
Statistical Analysis: Compute mean gene expression, identify highly and lowly expressed genes, and calculate tree growth statistics (mean, standard deviation, and 10-year growth differences).
Visualization: Generate histograms for mean gene expression and boxplots for tree circumference distributions by site.
Statistical Testing: Perform a Welch Two Sample t-test to compare 10-year tree growth between sites.

Part 2: Biological Sequence Diversity

Sequence Analysis: Compare coding DNA sequences (CDS) from E. coli and C. baratii using FASTA files from Ensembl Genomes.
Sequence Metrics: Calculate the number of coding sequences, total coding DNA length, and mean/median CDS lengths.
Frequency Analysis: Compute nucleotide and amino acid frequencies, and visualize with barplots.
Codon Usage: Analyze codon usage bias using Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) and visualize with barplots.
K-mer Analysis: Identify over- and under-represented protein k-mers (length 3â€“5) in C. baratii and compare with E. coli, supported by barplots.
